# Pointervisualizer
 

## About

Pointer visualizer is a graphical visualization tool hosted on a web application. Its goal is to help 
beginner programmers understand and imagin usages, functions and conceptual representation of pointers. 
It is a lesion-oriented approach to teach users and guide them through the initial and basic syntax and 
concept of complex C++ code. With scripted lessons users can visualize how pointers interact with data 
through memory addresses and their theoretical existence in the memory. Each lesson aims to convey progressively 
more complex topics regarding pointers in C++.

Please Note: Pointer Visualizer aims to help beginner programmers to grasp concepts. It is a voluntary project attempted by learning students
 and does not near guarantee literacy or simulation of actual compilers not 100% accuracy. It was our honest and best attempt to
help new developers avoid struggles we had in our days.
 It was an attempt to simplify concepts wherever needed and at times uses visual representation that may not exist in real compilers but aligns with human concepts of it.

## Hosting
Hosted on azure app service: http://pointervisualizer.azurewebsites.net/

[ashxxxx2@xxxxx.com]

## Web application built with
ASP.NET 4.7.1 MVC Template hosting Unity project built 
as javascripts using Unity WebGL.



## Rendering Engine used to build the project:
Unity 2019.3.15f1

hosted on separate github: 


## Future Possible Work

- The advanced feature of the tool, named sandbox was built. It was an approach where users can create and manipulate 
pointers and their pointer as their discretion and visualize their activity in the memory. 
The sandbox also allows users to visualize a linked list as they are a very common usage of pointers.
Visual bugs were not solved in the project hence removed from public access.

- The navigation of the lesson could be more interactive and re-imagined for a better approach.
- More lessons can be built using the immense ground work that has been put to this unity project.
